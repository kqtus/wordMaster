#wordMaster 
is a customizable dictionary for personal use. The main purpose is to help people learn new foreign words - for example, 
say you have seen a new, unknown to you word, and you can't help remembering it. With wordMaster you can save it and whenever you want, 
check again what does it mean. I am planning on adding GUI implementation with some cool features, but the project is yet in early stage.
